# Schedule Update Preservation Implementation

## Problem Solved

Previously, when schedule settings were updated (operating days, time slots, capacities), the `refresh_future_schedule()` function would:
1. Delete ALL future time slots
2. Delete ALL future open days  
3. Regenerate schedule based on new settings

This caused **existing bookings to lose their time slots**, potentially leading to:
- Booking validation failures
- Double bookings
- Orphaned bookings

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- Added `is_legacy` boolean column to `time_slots` table
- Added index for performance on legacy slots
- Legacy slots are marked permanently to preserve booking history

### 2. Enhanced Schedule Refresh Logic
The new `refresh_future_schedule()` function:
- **Preserves all time slots with confirmed bookings**
- **Updates capacities intelligently**:
  - If new capacity > old capacity: allows more bookings
  - If new capacity < old capacity: honors existing bookings, prevents new ones
- **Marks removed slots as legacy** instead of deleting them
- **Only deletes empty slots** that are no longer in the schedule

### 3. Customer Booking Protection
- **Availability API**: Excludes legacy slots from customer booking options
- **Booking API**: Prevents new bookings in legacy slots
- **Legacy slots are invisible** to customers but preserved for existing bookings

### 4. Admin Interface Support
- **Rescheduling**: Admins can reschedule existing bookings to any slot (including legacy)
- **Views Updated**: `time_slot_status` and `booking_summary` include legacy information
- **Full Visibility**: Admins see all bookings including those in legacy slots

### 5. Booking Validation
- **Reschedule Function**: Updated to handle legacy slots properly
- **Capacity Checking**: Respects both booking count and bouquet limits
- **Existing Bookings**: Can be rescheduled to any available slot

## Key Functions Updated

### `refresh_future_schedule()`
- Preserves slots with confirmed bookings
- Updates capacities based on new settings
- Marks removed slots as legacy
- Only deletes empty, invalid slots

### `generate_open_days_and_slots()`
- Respects existing slots during regeneration
- Updates non-legacy slots with new settings
- Preserves legacy slot capacities

### `reschedule_booking()`
- Allows rescheduling to legacy slots
- Maintains proper capacity validation
- Works for both customer and admin rescheduling

## Database Views Enhanced

### `time_slot_status`
- Includes `is_legacy` field
- Shows 'LEGACY_SLOT' status for removed slots
- Maintains booking counts and capacity info

### `booking_summary`
- Includes legacy slot information
- Preserves all booking-to-slot relationships

## Business Rules Enforced

1. **Existing bookings are NEVER cancelled** by system schedule changes
2. **Only admin or customer** can cancel bookings
3. **Legacy slots remain functional** for existing bookings
4. **New bookings are prevented** in legacy slots
5. **Capacity limits are respected** in all scenarios

## Migration Instructions

1. Run the migration in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Execute: database/migrations/preserve_existing_bookings_on_schedule_update.sql
   ```

2. Verify the migration worked:
   - Check `is_legacy` column exists in `time_slots`
   - Verify functions are updated
   - Test schedule updates preserve existing bookings

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Create bookings** in current schedule
2. **Update schedule settings** (remove days/times, change capacities)
3. **Verify existing bookings** are preserved and functional
4. **Confirm new bookings** only use active (non-legacy) slots
5. **Test rescheduling** works for both active and legacy slots

## Result

✅ **Existing bookings are always honored during schedule updates**
✅ **No double bookings possible**
✅ **Clean separation between active and legacy slots**
✅ **Full admin visibility and control**
✅ **Customer experience unaffected by schedule changes**
