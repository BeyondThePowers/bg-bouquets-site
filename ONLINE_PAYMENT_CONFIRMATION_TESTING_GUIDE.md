# üß™ Online Payment Confirmation Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive testing instructions for the new online payment confirmation email system that uses the unified Make.com router approach.

## üîß Prerequisites

### Environment Setup
Ensure these environment variables are configured:
```
MAKE_BOOKING_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hook.make.com/your-booking-webhook-id
SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=sandbox-sq0idb-your_application_id
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=EAAAl_your_sandbox_access_token
SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=your_location_id
SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY=your_webhook_signature_key
```

### Make.com Router Setup
- Router configured with two paths (pay-on-arrival vs online payment)
- Email templates updated with conditional content
- Both paths tested and activated

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Pay-on-Arrival Booking (Existing Flow)

**Purpose**: Verify existing pay-on-arrival confirmations still work

**Steps**:
1. Create a booking with `paymentMethod: "pay_on_arrival"`
2. Submit booking form
3. Check webhook logs for confirmation email trigger

**Expected Results**:
- Immediate confirmation email sent
- Email shows "Payment: Pay on Arrival"
- No payment reference numbers
- Standard cancellation/reschedule links

**Test Payload**:
```json
{
  "event": "booking_confirmed",
  "booking": {
    "payment": {
      "method": "pay_on_arrival",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  }
}
```

### Test 2: Online Payment Booking (New Flow)

**Purpose**: Verify online payment confirmations work after payment completion

**Steps**:
1. Create a booking with `paymentMethod: "pay_now"`
2. Complete Square payment process
3. Verify Square webhook triggers confirmation email

**Expected Results**:
- Confirmation email sent after payment completion
- Email shows "‚úÖ Payment Confirmed!"
- Includes payment amount and bouquet count
- Shows Square payment reference ID
- Includes refund policy information

**Test Payload**:
```json
{
  "event": "booking_confirmed",
  "booking": {
    "payment": {
      "method": "pay_now",
      "status": "completed",
      "squarePaymentId": "test-payment-123",
      "completedAt": "2025-07-01T10:30:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### Test 3: Square Webhook Integration

**Purpose**: Verify Square webhook properly triggers confirmation emails

**Steps**:
1. Create test booking with online payment
2. Use Square's webhook testing tools
3. Send test payment completion webhook
4. Verify confirmation email is triggered

**Square Test Webhook Payload**:
```json
{
  "type": "payment.updated",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "payment": {
        "id": "test-payment-123",
        "order_id": "test-order-456",
        "status": "COMPLETED",
        "amount_money": {
          "amount": 7000,
          "currency": "CAD"
