# üîß Cancellation Token Fix - Critical Issue Resolved

## üö® **Issue Identified**
The user correctly identified that the `cancellationToken` was missing from webhook payloads for cancellation, reschedule, and admin notification emails. This would have prevented customers from managing their rescheduled bookings.

## ‚úÖ **Root Cause**
- **Booking Confirmation**: ‚úÖ Already had `cancellationToken` in `metadata`
- **Cancellation Confirmation**: ‚ùå Missing `cancellationToken` 
- **Reschedule Confirmation**: ‚ùå Missing `cancellationToken`
- **Admin Cancellation**: ‚ùå Missing `cancellationToken`
- **Error Notification**: ‚úÖ Not applicable

## üîß **Files Fixed**

### 1. Webhook Service (`src/utils/webhookService.ts`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added `cancellationToken?: string` to `CancellationData` interface
- Added `cancellationToken?: string` to `RescheduleData` interface
- Updated all webhook payload structures to include `cancellationToken` in metadata

**Before:**
```typescript
metadata: {
  source: 'website',
  emailType: 'customer_cancellation_confirmation',
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
metadata: {
  source: 'website',
  emailType: 'customer_cancellation_confirmation',
  cancellationToken: cancellationData.cancellationToken,
}
```

### 2. Customer Cancellation API (`src/pages/api/cancel-booking.ts`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added `cancellationToken: bookingData.cancellation_token` to both webhook calls

### 3. Customer Reschedule API (`src/pages/api/reschedule-booking.ts`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added `cancellationToken: bookingData.cancellation_token` to webhook data

### 4. Admin Cancellation API (`src/pages/api/garden-mgmt/cancel-booking.ts`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added `cancellationToken: bookingData.cancellation_token` to both webhook calls

### 5. Admin Reschedule API (`src/pages/api/garden-mgmt/reschedule-booking.ts`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added `cancellationToken: bookingData.cancellation_token` to webhook data

### 6. Test Webhook (`src/pages/api/test-webhook.ts`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added `cancellationToken: 'test-cancellation-token-123'` to all test webhook calls

### 7. Documentation (`MAKE_COM_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`)
**Changes Made:**
- Updated all webhook payload examples to include `cancellationToken` in metadata

## üß™ **Testing Results**

### All Webhook Types Tested Successfully:
```bash
# Booking Confirmation - ‚úÖ Already working
curl -X POST http://localhost:4321/api/test-webhook -d '{"type": "confirmation"}'

# Cancellation Confirmation - ‚úÖ Now includes cancellationToken
curl -X POST http://localhost:4321/api/test-webhook -d '{"type": "cancellation"}'

# Reschedule Confirmation - ‚úÖ Now includes cancellationToken
curl -X POST http://localhost:4321/api/test-webhook -d '{"type": "reschedule"}'

# Admin Cancellation - ‚úÖ Now includes cancellationToken
curl -X POST http://localhost:4321/api/test-webhook -d '{"type": "cancellation-admin"}'

# Error Notification - ‚úÖ Working (no cancellationToken needed)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4321/api/test-webhook -d '{"type": "error"}'
```

## üìß **Email Template Impact**

### Templates Now Work Correctly:
All email templates can now properly use:
```html
<a href="https://bgbouquet.com/cancel?token={{booking.metadata.cancellationToken}}" class="button">
    Manage Your Booking
</a>
```

### Customer Experience Fixed:
- ‚úÖ **Booking Confirmation**: Customer can cancel/reschedule
- ‚úÖ **Cancellation Confirmation**: Customer can book again (link works)
- ‚úÖ **Reschedule Confirmation**: Customer can manage rescheduled booking
- ‚úÖ **Admin Actions**: All admin actions preserve customer management capabilities

## üéØ **Business Impact**

### Before Fix:

- Documentation updated with correct payload structures

### Next Steps:
